# Travexis TGL

TGL (Travexis Gate Language ) is a deterministic validation standard.

It defines:

- A minimal specification
- A fixed exit code contract
- A reproducible test suite
- A reference validator implementation

---

## Exit Code Contract (v0.1.0)

TGL defines exactly three exit codes:

- `0`  → PASS
- `10` → FAIL
- `20` → BLOCKED

Exit code is the single source of truth.
